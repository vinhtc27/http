#  HTTP Server Challenge in Rust build by CodeCrafters

This is solutions for Rust implementation of the ["Build Your Own HTTP Server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) on CodeCrafters.
In this challenge, I built an HTTP/1.1 server that can serve multiple clients concurrently.

## Overview

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) is the protocol that powers the World Wide Web. Throughout this challenge, you'll learn about TCP servers, [HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html), and other essential concepts related to building an HTTP server.

## Resources

- [HTTP/1.1 RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616): The official specification for the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): The official Rust programming language book, providing comprehensive documentation and examples.
- [CodeCrafters Rust Track](https://app.codecrafters.io/tracks/rust): A collection of challenges focused on building real-world applications in Rust.
